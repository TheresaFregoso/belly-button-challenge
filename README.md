# Intro to JavaScript Visualizations - the belly-button-challenge 
## Module 14 Challenge  
 
 This challenge has me build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset Links to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. 

 The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare

 The index.html file can used to load a local web page. Within the static/js folders is the JavaScript file that loads the data and creates the visualizations using plotly. 

 This project can be seen for a limited time at https://theresafregoso.github.io/ 
 
 This project would not have been possible without the help of ChatGPT assisting me with proper structure of commands.
